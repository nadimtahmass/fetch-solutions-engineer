Subject: Data Quality Issues Identified in Fetch Rewards Data

Hi John Appleseed,

As part of our data quality assessment, we have identified several issues that could impact analytics and reporting. Below is a summary of our key findings:

Key Data Quality Issues:
1. Missing Data:
	- Receipts:
		- totalSpent is missing in 435 cases.
		- purchaseDate is missing in 448 cases.
		- rewardsReceiptItemList (list of purchased items) is missing in 440 cases.
	- Users:
		- state is missing in 56 records.
		- lastLogin is missing in 62 records.
	- Brands:
		- categoryCode is missing in 650 records.
		- topBrand flag is missing in 612 records.

2. Duplicate Data:
	- 283 duplicate user records were found, which could impact user-related reports.

3. Referential Integrity Issues:
	- 1,119 receipts reference non-existent users, meaning these transactions cannot be linked to a valid customer.

4. Outliers in Total Spend:
	- 55 receipts have unusually high transaction amounts (e.g., $4,721.95, $4,368.80, $4,566.17), suggesting potential anomalies or incorrect data entries.


Impact on Business Insights:
	- Missing totalSpent and purchaseDate values could distort revenue-based reports and time-based analyses.
	- Missing rewardsReceiptItemList prevents accurate calculations of item-level sales trends.
	- High outliers in totalSpent could lead to skewed insights in top-spending customers and brand performance reports.
	- Duplicate users may cause inaccurate user behavior metrics.


Next Steps & Recommendations:
	- Data Cleaning: 
		- Remove or correct missing values where possible, especially in key metrics like totalSpent and purchaseDate.
	- Duplicate Handling: 
		- Identify and merge duplicate users to prevent redundant data in reports.
	- Investigate Outliers: 
		- Confirm whether high total spend values are valid transactions or errors.
	- User-Receipt Mapping: 
		- Determine why over 1,100 receipts reference non-existent users and correct the issue.

Would love to discuss these findings and determine priorities for fixing them. Let me know a good time to sync.

Thanks,
